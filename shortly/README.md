## My process

### What I learned

I learned more about fetching and using SCSS, It's a bit messy because I'm learning the structure etc.

### Continued development

I don't like the font-size and the responsive side of the project, I have to focus on that.
There is a big mess because of Bootstrap, I should have been implement them on my own.
